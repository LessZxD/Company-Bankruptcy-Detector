Company Bankruptcy Detector Overview

Overview of Company Bankruptcy Detector

The Company Bankruptcy Detector is a Python program designed to forecast the probability of a company experiencing bankruptcy by analyzing a range of financial and non-financial variables. The program employs logistic regression, a widely used machine learning algorithm, to construct a bankruptcy prediction model. The model can offer valuable insights to financial institutions, investors, and policymakers by analyzing historical data and assessing crucial characteristics. This empowers them to make well-informed decisions and minimize financial risks. Characteristics


    The Logistic Regression Model employs logistic regression for the purpose of bankruptcy prediction. This model is known for its interpretability, high performance, and widespread use in credit scoring models.
    
    Data preprocessing involves the tasks of loading data, performing preprocessing operations, and selecting relevant features in order to prepare the dataset for model training.
    
    The process of model training and evaluation involves dividing the dataset into separate training and testing sets. The logistic regression model is then trained using the training set, and its performance is assessed using different       
    evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
    
    Prediction: Offers the capability to generate bankruptcy forecasts for newly established companies using their inputted features.

Utilization

    Data Preparation: Create a dataset that includes important characteristics and a target variable that indicates whether a company is bankrupt (0 = not bankrupt, 1 = bankrupt).
    Model Training: Execute the program to train the logistic regression model using the prepared dataset.
    Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the trained model by utilizing the specified evaluation metrics on a distinct testing dataset.
    Forecast: Utilize the trained model to generate bankruptcy forecasts for novel companies by supplying their feature inputs.
